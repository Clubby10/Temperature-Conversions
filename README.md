# temperature-conversions
A Java program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program prompts the user to enter a temperature value and scale, and then converts the temperature to the other two scales using the appropriate formulas. The converted temperatures are then printed out to the console.
